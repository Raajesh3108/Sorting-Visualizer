## Description :
The Interactive Bubble Sort Visualizer is a meticulously crafted web application, leveraging the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an intuitive and educational experience in the realm of sorting algorithms. This project focuses on visualizing the Bubble Sort algorithm, providing users with a clear understanding of its mechanics.

## Key Features :
- Intuitive User Interface : The application offers a clean and user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless navigation experience for users.
- Real-Time Sorting Visualization: Users can observe the Bubble Sort algorithm in action, as the application dynamically updates the visual representation of the array being sorted.
- Bubble Sort Algorithm: This visualizer is dedicated to showcasing the workings of the Bubble Sort algorithm, a fundamental sorting technique. Users can witness firsthand how this algorithm iteratively compares and swaps adjacent elements until the entire array is sorted.
- Customizable Array Size: Users have the ability to adjust the size of the input array, allowing for experimentation with different data set configurations.
- Interactive Controls: The application offers a range of interactive controls, including play, pause, reset, and step, enabling users to explore the sorting process at their own pace.
- Sound Integration : In an upcoming enhancement, sound cues will be synchronized with the sorting process, providing an additional sensory dimension to the learning experience.
- Responsive Design: The visualizer is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal functionality across various devices and screen sizes.
- Code Insights (Optional): For users interested in the underlying code, the visualizer offers an optional view of the JavaScript implementation, providing a deeper insight into the Bubble Sort algorithm.
